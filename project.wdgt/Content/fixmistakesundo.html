        <dt>git reset</dt>
        <dd>
           Resets the index (i.e., removes all changes staged for commit) but does not modify the working tree (i.e., the changes in the files are preserved).
        </dd>

        <dt>git reset <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
           Sets the current HEAD to the commit specified by <span
           class="argterm">rev</span>, and resets the index but not the working tree.
        </dd>

        <dt>git reset <span class="argterm">rev</span> -- <span class="argterm">path</span></dt>
        <dd>
           Restores file or files specified by <span class="argterm">path</span> to
           version specified by <span class="argterm">rev</span>, <emph>without</emph> moving HEAD.
        </dd>

        <dt>git reset --soft <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
           Sets the current HEAD to the commit specified by <span
           class="argterm">rev</span>, but keep changes in the index for editing. For example, if something was forgotten or omitted in the previous commit, &quot;<code>git reset --soft HEAD^</code>&quot; will undo the last commit, and keep all changes in the index for editing and the next commit.
        </dd>

        <dt>git reset --hard</dt>
        <dd>
        Abandon <strong>all</strong> changes since last commit, restoring working tree to its last committed state (plus untracked files).
        </dd>

        <dt>git reset --hard <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
        As above, but with reference to commit specified by <span
        class="argterm">rev</span>. For example, &quot;<code>git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD</code>&quot; will undo the most recent <em>successful</em> merge <em>and</em> any changes that occurred after. Useful for forgetting about the merge just done.  If there are conflicts (the merge was not successful), use &quot;<code>git reset --hard</code>&quot; instead.
        </dd>

        <dt>git commit --amend [-m <span class="argterm">msg</span>]</dt>
        <dd>
        Replace last commit message with <span class="argterm">msg</span> if given,
        or open editor to edit last commit message.
        </dd>

    </dl>
