    All of the following can be modified by a &quot;<code>[-- <span class="argterm">path(s)</span>]</code>&quot; argument clause, which limits the operations to the file or files found on <code><span class="argterm">path(s)</span></code>.

    <dl class="gitcommandhelp">
        <dt>git reset</dt>
        <dd>
           Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files are
           preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated.
        </dd>

        <dt>git reset <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
           Sets the current head to the commit specified by <span
           class="argterm">rev</span>, which can be any SHA1 commit ID, branch
           name, or tag, and resets the index but not the working tree.
        </dd>

        <dt>git reset --soft</dt>
        <dd>
            Undo last commit, but keep all changes since in the index for editing.
        </dd>

        <dt>git reset --soft <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
           Sets the current head to the commit specified by <span
           class="argterm">rev</span>, which can be any SHA1 commit ID, branch
           name, or tag, but keep changes in the index for editing. For example, if something was forgotten or omitted in the previous commit, &quot;<code>git reset --soft HEAD^</code>&quot; will undo the last commit, and keep all changes in the index for editing and the next commit.
        </dd>

        <dt>git reset --hard</dt>
        <dd>
        Abandon all changes since last commit, restoring working tree to its last committed state (plus untracked files).
        </dd>

        <dt>git reset --hard <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
        As above, but with reference to commit specified by <span
        class="argterm">rev</span>, which can be any SHA1 commit ID, branch
        name, or tag. For example, &quot;<code>git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD</code>&quot; will undo the most recent <em>successful</em> merge <em>and</em> any changes that occurred after.  Useful for forgetting about the merge just done.  If there are conflicts (the merge was not successful), use &quot;<code>git reset --hard</code>&quot; instead.
        </dd>

        <dt>git commit --amend [-m <span class="argterm">msg</span>]</dt>
        <dd>
        Replace last commit message with <span class="argterm">msg</span> if given,
        or open editor to edit last commit message.
        </dd>

    </dl>
