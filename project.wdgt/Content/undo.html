    <p class="subsectiontitle">Reverting</p>
    Reverting is different from resetting in that the changeset is applied to the current working tree (or specific files in the working tree if a &quot;<code>path</code>&quot; argument is given), without modifying the index or changing HEAD. In other words, the reverts are applied as <em>new</em> modifications to the <em>current</em> state of the repository, as opposed to returning to a previous point in history and &quot;starting&quot; from there.
    <dl class="gitcommandhelp">
        <dt>git revert <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
        Reverse commit specified by <span class="argterm">rev</span>. This does <em>not</em> do the same thing as similarly named commands in other VCS's such as &quot;<code>svn revert</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>bzr revert</code>&quot;.
        </dd>
        <dt>git checkout <span class="argterm">path(s)</span></dt>
        <dd>
        Re-checkout file or files specified by <span class="argterm">path(s)</span>, overwriting any local changes. This is most similar to &quot;<code>svn revert</code>&quot;.
        </dd>
        <dt>git checkout <span class="argterm">rev</span> <span class="argterm">path(s)</span></dt>
        <dd>
        Re-checkout file or files specified by <span class="argterm">path(s)</span> to version specified by <span class="argterm">rev</span>.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="subsectiontitle">Resetting</p>
    <dl class="gitcommandhelp">
        <dt>git reset</dt>
        <dd>
           Resets the index (i.e., removes all changes staged for commit) but does not modify the working tree (i.e., the changes in the files are preserved), and does not change HEAD.
        </dd>
        <dt>git reset <span class="argterm">rev</span> -- <span class="argterm">path</span></dt>
        <dd>
           Restores file or files specified by <span class="argterm">path</span> to
           version specified by <span class="argterm">rev</span>, without changing HEAD.
        </dd>
        <dt>git reset <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
           Sets the current HEAD to the commit specified by <span
           class="argterm">rev</span>, and resets the index but not the working tree (i.e current changes in the working tree are preserved).
        </dd>
        <dt>git reset --soft <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
           Sets the current HEAD to the commit specified by <span
           class="argterm">rev</span>, and does not modify the working tree, but keeps changes in the index for editing. For example, if something was forgotten or omitted in the previous commit, &quot;<code>git reset --soft HEAD^</code>&quot; will undo the last commit, and keep all changes in the index for editing and the next commit.
        </dd>
        <dt>git reset --hard</dt>
        <dd>
        Abandon <strong>all</strong> changes since last commit, restoring working tree to its last committed state (plus untracked files).
        </dd>
        <dt>git reset --hard <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
         Sets the current HEAD to the commit specified by <span
           class="argterm">rev</span>, and changes the working tree to mirror the new HEAD (plus untracked files). For example, &quot;<code>git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD</code>&quot; will undo the most recent <em>successful</em> merge <em>and</em> any changes that occurred after. Useful for forgetting about the merge just done.  If there are conflicts (the merge was not successful), use &quot;<code>git reset --hard</code>&quot; instead.
