    <p class="subsectiontitle">Reverting</p>
    Reverting is different from resetting in that the changeset is applied to the current working tree (or specific files in the working tree if a &quot;<code>path</code>&quot; argument is given), without modifying the index or changing HEAD. In other words, the changes are recorded as modifications to the current state of the repository, with the entire history up to the current state preserved.
    <dl class="gitcommandhelp">
        <dt>git revert <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
        Reverse commit specified by <span class="argterm">rev</span>. This does <em>not</em> do the same thing as similarly named commands in other VCS's such as &quot;<code>svn revert</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>bzr revert</code>&quot;.
        </dd>
        <dt>git checkout <span class="argterm">path(s)</span></dt>
        <dd>
        Re-checkout file or files specified by <span class="argterm">path(s)</span>, overwriting any local changes. This is most similar to &quot;<code>svn revert</code>&quot;.
        </dd>
        <dt>git checkout <span class="argterm">rev</span> <span class="argterm">path(s)</span></dt>
        <dd>
        Re-checkout file or files specified by <span class="argterm">path(s)</span> to version specified by <span class="argterm">rev</span>.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="sectionsubtitle">Resetting</p>
    <dl class="gitcommandhelp">
        <dt>git reset</dt>
        <dd>
           Resets the index (i.e., removes all changes staged for commit) but does not modify the working tree (i.e., the changes in the files are preserved).
        </dd>
        <dt>git reset <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
           Sets the current HEAD to the commit specified by <span
           class="argterm">rev</span>, and resets the index but not the working tree.
        </dd>
        <dt>git reset <span class="argterm">rev</span> -- <span class="argterm">path</span></dt>
        <dd>
           Restores file or files specified by <span class="argterm">path</span> to
           version specified by <span class="argterm">rev</span>, <emph>without</emph> moving HEAD.
        </dd>
        <dt>git reset --soft <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
           Sets the current HEAD to the commit specified by <span
           class="argterm">rev</span>, but keep changes in the index for editing. For example, if something was forgotten or omitted in the previous commit, &quot;<code>git reset --soft HEAD^</code>&quot; will undo the last commit, and keep all changes in the index for editing and the next commit.
        </dd>
        <dt>git reset --hard</dt>
        <dd>
        Abandon <strong>all</strong> changes since last commit, restoring working tree to its last committed state (plus untracked files).
        </dd>
        <dt>git reset --hard <span class="argterm">rev</span></dt>
        <dd>
        As above, but with reference to commit specified by <span
        class="argterm">rev</span>. For example, &quot;<code>git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD</code>&quot; will undo the most recent <em>successful</em> merge <em>and</em> any changes that occurred after. Useful for forgetting about the merge just done.  If there are conflicts (the merge was not successful), use &quot;<code>git reset --hard</code>&quot; instead.
        </dd>
        <dt>git commit --amend [-m <span class="argterm">msg</span>]</dt>
        <dd>
        Replace last commit message with <span class="argterm">msg</span> if given,
        or open editor to edit last commit message.
        </dd>
    </dl>
