    In all of the following, a merge strategy can be specified by the &quot;<code>-s <span class="argterm">strategy</span></code>&quot; argument, which can be one of: &quot;resolve&quot;, &quot;recursive&quot;, &quot;octopus&quot;, &quot;ours&quot;, or &quot;subtree&quot;. If you tried a merge which resulted in a complex conflicts and would want to start over, you can recover with &quot;<code>git reset --hard</code>&quot. If you accidently merged and want to unmerge, you can &quot;<code>git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD</code>&quot;.
