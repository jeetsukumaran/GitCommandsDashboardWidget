        <dd>
          Work through conflicted files by opening them in your mergetool (opendiff,
          kdiff3, etc.) and choosing left/right chunks. The merged result is staged for
          commit.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    For binary files or if mergetool won't do, resolve the conflict(s) manually and
    then do:

    <pre>
    git add <span class="argterm">file1</span> [<span class="argterm">file2</span> ...]
    </pre>

    Once all conflicts are resolved and staged, commit the pending merge with:

    <pre>
    git commit
    </pre>

</div>
