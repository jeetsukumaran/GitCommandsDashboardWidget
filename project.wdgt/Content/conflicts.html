<div class="section">
    <p class="sectiontitle">Conflicts</p>
    Work through conflicted files by opening them in your mergetool (opendiff,
    kdiff3, etc.) and choosing left/right chunks:
    <pre>
        git mergetool
    </pre>
    The merged result is staged for commit.

    For binary files or if mergetool won't do, resolve the conflict(s) manually and
    then do:
    <pre>
        git add <span class="argterm">file1</span> [<span class="argterm">file2</span> ...]
    </pre>

    Once all conflicts are resolved and staged, commit the pending merge with:
    <pre>
        git commit
    </pre>
</div>
